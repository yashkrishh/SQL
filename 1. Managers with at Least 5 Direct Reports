select name from Employee
where id in (select managerId from (select managerId,count(*) 
from Employee group by managerId having count(*) >=5) as subquery) 



---every derived table (subquery) in MySQL must have its own alias : Hence "as subquery"

/* PostgreSQL treats cnt as a column alias in the derived table, 
but it doesn't allow direct reference to aliases in the HAVING clause. 
Instead, you need to refer to the expression that creates the alias (i.e., COUNT(*)), not the alias itself */
